<h2><span style="color:#6600FF;">CS162
Lab 4 Personal Organizer Version 3 </span></h2>

<h3><i><span style="color:red;">Do-Not
List for All Labs in CS162: </span></i></h3>

<ul type="disc">
 <li class="MsoNormal"><span>No Global Variables (you can have global constants)</span></li>
 <li class="MsoNormal"><span>No use of the stdio library (use iostream and fstream)</span></li>
 <li class="MsoNormal"><span>Instead of the string class, you will be using arrays
     of characters and the cstring library</span></li>
</ul>

<h3><i><span style="color:lime;">Things
You Should Do: </span></i></h3>

<ul type="disc">
 <li class="MsoNormal"><span>Follow the style guide for this class </span></li>
 <li class="MsoNormal"><span>Your programs should always guard against bad data
     being entered by mistake</span></li>
 <li class="MsoNormal"><span>You can always do more than the assignments require</span></li>
</ul>

<h3><span style="color:#6600FF;">Goals
for This Lab:</span></h3>

<ul type="disc">
 <li class="MsoNormal"><span>More about class and OOP </span></li>
 <li class="MsoNormal"><span>Using pointers and dynamic memory; focusing on dynamic
     arrays. </span></li>
 <li class="MsoNormal"><span>Using memory leak detection tool </span></li>
</ul>

<h3><span style="color:#6600FF;">Problem
You Need to Solve for This Lab: (Same as Lab 2) </span></h3>

<p>You have noticed that there is a lot to do this term as we get familiar with
C++ and programming on a larger scale. With a full load of classes, you may
have many due dates to meet. Keeping track of everything is important. You have
decided to write a program that reads tasks from the user and saves them in a
data file to keep track of.</p>

<h3><span style="color:#6600FF;">What
Your Program Should Do: (Same as Lab 2) </span></h3>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Write
an interactive text based menu interface (using a loop) that will allow the
user to </span></p>

<ul type="disc">
 <li class="MsoNormal"><span>Enter a task or assignment</span></li>
 <li class="MsoNormal"><span>Display all of the tasks that are in the file</span></li>
 <li class="MsoNormal"><span>Find a task by Course </span></li>
 <li class="MsoNormal"><span>Quit</span></li>
</ul>

<p>For each task, you need to keep track of:</p>

<ul type="disc">
 <li class="MsoNormal"><span>Course Name that it is for (e.g., CS162)</span></li>
 <li class="MsoNormal"><span>Description of the assignment (e.g., Finish Lab 2)</span></li>
 <li class="MsoNormal"><span>Due date (e.g., 9/26/2009) </span></li>
</ul>

<p>Allow the program to keep looping until user wants to quit. When the program
starts, it should load the tasks from external file (<span class="style61">"tasks.txt"</span>)
into memory. When user enters the three items of a task, the program needs to
read them in, save them in memory and eventually write them to the external
data file (<span class="style61">"tasks.txt"</span>). The file format
could look like: (The ';' is used as a delimiter or field seperator.) </p>

<p class="style1">CS162;Finish Lab 2;9/26/2009<br>
CS201;Take Quiz 1;9/28/2009 </p>

<blockquote style="margin-top:5.0pt;margin-bottom:5.0pt;">

<p class="style1">&nbsp; </p>

<h3><span style="color:#6600FF;">Some
Implementation Requirements: (Different from Lab 2 and Lab 3!!!) </span></h3>

<ol start="1" type="1">
 <li class="MsoNormal"><span>Use structs or class named </span><span class="style61"><span>Task</span></span><span> to model task. You
     really should think about changing the struct to class if you have not
     done so in Lab 2. </span></li>
 <li class="MsoNormal"><span>Use class named </span><span class="style61"><span>TaskList</span></span><span> to model the collection
     of tasks.</span></li>
 <li class="MsoNormal"><span>Use <strong><i>dynamic</i></strong> array of </span><span class="style61"><span>Task</span></span><span> to implement </span><span class="style61"><span>TaskList</span></span><span>. </span></li>
 <li class="MsoNormal"><span>Use <strong><i>dynamic </i></strong>character array to
     model the strings in </span><span class="style61"><span>Task, </span></span><span>such as course name, task description and due date. The
     character array should be the exact size as needed, e.g "CS162"
     should use an charcter array of size 6 including '\0'. </span></li>
 <li class="MsoNormal"><span>Use </span><span class="style61"><span>destructor</span></span><span> to deallocate the dynamic memory for the object. </span></li>
 <li class="MsoNormal"><span>Make sure your program is "memory-leak-free"
     by using the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/e5ewb1h3.aspx">memory leak
     detection tool</a>. Please view the video in the module for detailed
     instructions about how to enable the tool in your program. </span></li>
 <li class="MsoNormal"><span>When using class, please make sure you encapsulate the
     data which means make all the instance data member</span><span class="style61"><span>
     private</span></span><span>
     and provide accessor methods and mutator methods to access and manipulate
     the data. </span></li>
</ol>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3><span style="color:#6600FF;">How
To Submit Your Work:</span></h3>

<p><em><b>First, “clean” your project by doing the following: </b></em></p>

<ul type="disc">
 <li class="MsoNormal"><span>execute <strong>Clean Solution</strong> in the <strong>Build</strong>
     menu </span></li>
 <li class="MsoNormal"><span>close Visual Studio, and then delete the <strong>.ncb</strong>
     file from your solution’s root folder </span></li>
</ul>

<p>After cleaning your project, compress it into a <strong>.zip</strong> file.
Because you cleaned your project, your <strong>.zip</strong> file will be as
small as possible. Make sure you have your Zip application set to <em>preserve
the folder structure</em> of your project. By doing these things, you will
ensure your .zip file is as small as possible, which will make both your upload
and my download quicker. <br>
<br>
<em><b>Submit the .zip file containing your cleaned project to Desire2Learn:</b></em></p>

<p>Upload into the "Dropbox" section of Desire2Learn the zip file for
your cleaned project.&nbsp; Please be sure the source file includes your name,
assignment description and number, and date, as a program comment!</p>

<p>Be certain to check that you completed the upload successfully. After you
click the "Add" button, you must also click the "Submit"
button at the bottom of the page. This is very easy to forget. You have been
warned.</p>

<p>You may upload as many versions as you wish prior to the due date. I will
only see and grade the last one. You won’t be able to upload assignments after
due date.</p>
